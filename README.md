# An Exploration of Senate Votes and Divisive Issues 

This is an attempt to understand how senators vote with/against party lines, identify what issues and bills tend to be the most polarizing, and explore applications of SVD/PCA, projections, and more. I don't know why our nation and our legislatures are so divided. I'm not sure where data science fits in amidst this complex political, social, and economic landscape. But I want to understand it somehow, and that starts with experimentation - even if it may not lead anywhere!

## What's in the repo:
1. An iPython notebook describing the data acquisition and preprocessing steps
2. Preprocessed data for analysis
3. Another iPython notebook containing the analysis itself
4. This readme, for a high-level summary of the project
5. Famous political quotes (my selection is not representative of my political views or those of my employer)

## Political Quotes

* "A house divided cannot take meaningful action on immigration reform. Or healthcare policy. Campaign finance too? Anything really. I guess what I'm saying is that it can't stand?" - Abraham Lincoln, probably 
* "I am the Senate!" - ~~Chancellor Palpatine~~ Mitch McConnell, probably
